    <title>Mifare Classic Read Write Tool for Residential Zone 7</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Original Intention</h1>
    <p>The original intention of this project is to try to crack the
      access card used in my residential area, because the vendor
      challenged us that it is INVINCIBLE, nobody can clone it, but I
      have the mindset that in our IT world, nothing is impossible,
      maybe require more time to crack with worst brute-force method. <br>
    </p>
    <p>First I found the card type is Mifare 1K by using smartphone's
      NFC feature. Then I searched for card read write device, found
      ACR122U-A9 with ~USD16, quite cheap and decided to give it a try.<br>

    </p>
    <h1>Cracking</h1>
    <p>After trying various of Windows and Linux cracking tools
      (including default tools from device seller), no clue. Finally, I
      managed to crack it with Kali Linux 2018.2 and <a
        href="https://github.com/vaneay/crypto1_bs">https://github.com/vaneay/crypto1_bs</a>
      in less than 5 minutes. The INVINCIBLE design did not implement
      full encryption to the card, Key B in all 16 sectors is default
      value with <font color="#3333ff">FFFFFF</font>. So, the cracking
      process is easy by using Key B to find Key A. Found data on Sector
      0 Block 0 and Sector 1 Block 0 only after cracking. The ID of
      access card is written on Sector 1 Block 0 Byte 1 &amp; Byte 2
      without any encryption, and the system does not validate any data
      on Sector 0 Block 0 for UID BCC SAK ATQA, the system read Sector 1
      with Key A only to compare if the ID is valid in the database.<img

      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h1>Improvement</h1>
    <p>Full encryption with all different Key A and Key B creates a
      tight security to Mifare 1K card. So, I decided to add a value to
      Key B to replace default <font color="#3333ff">FFFFFF</font>. I
      just put similar Key B for all 16 sectors in the app (by right it
      should be all different values, but I think this should be enough,
      you can modify the coding to all different Key B values if you
      insist to).<br>
    </p>
    <p>I also added <b>Address </b>of owner to Sector 1 Block 1 for
      more information to the card, so that management will know easily
      of lost card owner by just scanning the card with the app.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h1>About The App</h1>
    <p>I decided to inform my residential area's RC (Resident Committee)
      about the cracking information with the purpose to enhance it
      before anyone can crack it easily and clone it infinitely.
      Actually there are some people selling card cloning service,
      sooner or later they will be able to crack it with tools provided
      from Internet.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To ease the creation of card in new full encryption data, I coded
      this mobile app to use in Android smartphone with NFC feature.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Since there is no validation to data on Sector 0 Block 0
      especially on UID of card, so it is much easier for the app, can
      be written to almost any writable card without any issue.<br>
    </p>
    <p>App is developed by using Android Studio. There are only 2 main
      pages + 1 info page in the app. The core Mifare Classic library
      forked from <a
        href="https://github.com/ikarus23/MifareClassicTool">https://github.com/ikarus23/MifareClassicTool</a>
      but has been simplified for the usage of this app only, forked
      codes in Common.java and MCReader.java. Variables of Key A and Key
      B located at Common.java named <b>KEYA_ZONE7</b> and <b>KEYB_ZONE7</b>
      respectively (I will not disclose the Key A and Key B of my
      residential access card, I just simply replaced with some values
      in coding).<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
      READ page: Read the Mifare card, displays UID + ID of the card
      that used to validate with system + Address.<br>
      <img src="app_read.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="574"><br>
    </p>
    <p>WRITE page: Write to blank or overwrite to a writable card, with
      info of ID and Address (No UID changes because the system does not
      validate UID, any UID will do).<br>

    <p>INFO page: Version info, description and credits of the app. BTW,
      <b>Zone7 </b>is my residential name. <br>

    <h1>Post Scriptum</h1>
    <p>This project has been completed early 2019, but not uploaded to
      Github yet because of lazy to write this documentation. Finally I
      have completed this before moving towards a new project. Next
      project will be openCV related to read car plate and face
      recognition and movement detection, mainly to enhance my
      residential security. It is big but I hope to completed it before
      end of 2020 (I work on these kind of projects as hobby on my free
      time, it depends on how free am I or no other interesting projects
      to put on priority).<br>
